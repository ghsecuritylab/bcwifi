DNSCrypt is a slight variation on DNSCurve.

DNSCurve improves confidentiality and integrity of DNS requests using
high-speed high-security elliptic-curve cryptography. Best of all,
DNSCurve has a very low overhead and adds virtually no latency to
queries.

DNSCurve aims at securing the entiere chain down to authoritative
servers. But it only works with authoritative servers that explicitly
support the protocol.

The DNSCrypt protocol is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on
securing communications between a client and its first-level resolver.
While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the local
network, which is often the weakest point of the chain, against
man-in-the-middle attacks. It also provides some confidentiality to
DNS queries.
