    Initialize dcps before using it, duh.
    It used to make virtually any plugin crash before it even had a chance
    to load on Linux, and on platforms it used to work on, it worked by
    accident.

Date:   2012-09-02

    Add prefilters for TCP.

Date:   2012-09-02

    Don't use max_packet_size. When using TCP, the packet size is not the data
    size, so, use the 'packet' terminology to actually mean a packet size, and
    something different to mean a DNS packet.
    No change to the compiled code, but it will help to make things more
    consistent between udp_request.c and tcp_request.c.

Date:   2012-09-02

    Don't use dns_packet*, use dns_(query|reply)* in udp_request.c just like in
    tcp_request.c

Date:   2012-06-24

    libevent: resurrect evdns_set_random_bytes_fn() and add evdns_set_random_init_fn().
    Using the provided RC4 generator is nice, but we maybe want to use something
    else, in particular if we need something that is guaranteed to work in a
    chroot jail, without a /dev/*random device.

Date:   2012-06-24

    libevent: don't use memset(<something on the stack>) to securely wipe a buffer,
